# Water Quality Prediction - College Project ðŸŒŠðŸ’§

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project predicts **water potability** (safe or unsafe for drinking) using **machine learning models** like XGBoost and Random Forest. It focuses on **data preprocessing, feature importance analysis, model evaluation, and visualizations** to enhance insights. Built using Python and machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and Seaborn, this project aims to improve water quality assessment with accurate predictions.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset is sourced from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)**. However, the data quality was not as great as expected, requiring **preprocessing and handling missing values** to improve the modelâ€™s performance.

## ðŸ”¥ Challenges Faced

- The dataset had missing values, requiring **median imputation**.
- Data imbalance affected model predictions, so **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** was applied.
- Feature importance had to be analyzed to ensure the most relevant attributes contributed to the prediction.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

- **Feature Engineering:** Extracting more meaningful features to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Deep Learning Integration:** Implementing neural networks for enhanced classification.
- **Real-time Prediction:** Creating a web app or API for real-time water quality assessments.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack Used

**Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Seaborn, Matplotlib**
